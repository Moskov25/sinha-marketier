  <h1>Our Story - Sinha Marketier</h1>

  <p><em>“I’ve always been someone who picks up skills fast. I learned design, content, ads, funnels, SEO — not because someone told me to, but because I was curious. I enjoyed building things and figuring out how to make them grow.”</em></p>

  <p>Coming from a tech background, I knew how to execute. But when it came to jobs, something never clicked. Despite learning all sides of digital marketing — from content to strategy — the calls never came. The big brands never looked past the resume.</p>

  <p>I wasn’t from a top college. I didn’t have referrals. But I had something they didn’t see: <strong>a full-stack marketing mindset</strong> and a hunger to build.</p>

  <p>So instead of waiting around, I started my own thing.</p>

  <p>That’s how <strong>Sinha Marketier</strong> came to life — just me and two close friends from college — one who’s now at Amazon, and the other who’s chosen to stay lowkey.</p>

  <p>We started this with a clear vision:<br>
  <em>To help businesses — especially growing brands — understand how to scale online, the right way.</em></p>

  <p>No fluff, no shortcuts. Just real strategy, clean execution, and consistent results.</p>

  <p>We work in <strong>three clear marketing tiers</strong>, crafted to help companies at different stages. You’ll find them on our homepage. If our story resonates with you — whether you’re a founder, startup team, or just someone trying to grow online —</p>

  <p><strong>Let’s talk.</strong></p>
